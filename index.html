<H3>Herb Magic</h3>
<p> Herb-based magic is one of the easiest and most popular forms of magic to start with. It&#39;s affordable(all of it can be found at your local grocery store)and versatile. Herbs can be burned, mixed into teas, scattered, kept in a charm bag, or anything else you can think of to do with them. Here’s a rundown of some of my favorite herbs to use in my craft and what they&#39;re for.

<p>Okay, <i>maybe</i> all of this isn’t so easy to find in the herbs and spices aisle, but you can get all of it online, at any rate! I buy mine for cheap right <a href="http://herb-magic.com/">here.</a></p>

<H3>Crystal Magic</h3>
<p>Crystals can be a really rewarding part of your craft. They’re relatively cheap, can be found online or at your local Pagan/new age store, and are beautiful to have around the house. Crystals are said by many to give off energy that’s useful in shellwork and meditation. Many crystals correspond to metaphysical <b>energy points</b> in the human body. Every crystal is different, and I would recommend choosing your in-person so you can get a feel for their energies. Here are a few of the ones I use. <del>Some vendors try to charge you much more than what they’re worth,</del> so shop wisely!
