<H2>About Me</h2>
</div>
<p>I should probably introduce myself. I&#39;m Vane! I&#39;ve been a witch for a while now, 
and magic has been a big part of my life since I was very small. I mostly practice alone and haven&#39;t aligned myself with 
any covens in the area, but my roommates are all fellow witches and we frequently practice together. My specialties include:
<ul> 
<li><p>Fire magic (e.g. candle work, burning sigils, etc.)</p></li>
<li><p>Sigil making</p></li>
<li><p>Potion making</p></li>
<li><p>Bone magic</p></li>
<li><p>Meditation and trances</p></li>
<li><p>Spellcasting (with an emphasis on protective magic)</p></li>
</ul>

<H5>An example of a magic sigil</h5>
<p>I&#39;m still a young witch with a lot to learn! I hope to have an inbox up and running soon so my readers can share their craft with me and help me build my grimoire!
